        "post_text": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams. And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for \"low quality\".  So here's the more TLDR version of my thesis:  \n  \nThe Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects. \n\nThe entire AI \"Growth\" story ends in 2026 if there's no InP substrates + materials. \u00a0\n\nBUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL? One Company: $AXTI. \n\nThere's two bottlenecks:\n\nInP Substrates -   \n  \n\\- Hyperscaler optics (TPU pods, etc)   \n\\- Optical transceivers (5g, data)   \n\\- LiDAR (robotaxis, drones, military)   \n\\-Optical Modules (interconnect clusters)   \n\\- Silicon photonics laser dies (Nvidia\u2019s future co-packaged optics and Intel/Broadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays.)  \n  \nThis is a DUOPOLY  from  \n\\-AXTI (est. \\~30\u201335%)   \n\\-Sumitomo (est.\\~30%)   \n\\- JX Nippon (est. 10-15%)\n\nIndium Phosphide (the source material for everything): \n\nVital Materials - 35%   \nAXT - 25%  \n  \nBefore, this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom.\n\nNow they're used for the entire AI buildout. \n\nJust to give u an example $AXTI -&gt; $LITE -&gt; $GOOGL TPU. without any of these members, the program shuts down.   \n  \nGoogle would literally pay $5B (50 TIMES prices + \\~$140m TAM from 2024) DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers -&gt; hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesn't stall because Meta decided to buy them out. And this would only be a like a 3-4% added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap. If Meta does it first, then Google's TPU program stalls. If Google does it first Microsoft's ASIC problem stalls.   \n  \nTHE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW (demand &gt; supply by multiple factors pre-ramp) AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains. \n\nGuess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck? Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck\n\nAXTI.   \n  \nThis is the holy grail of supply chain analysis + materials research. Nobody's posted about this stock here in the past 5 years, you're welcome. \n\nAnyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday, because there's a low chance this goes from $15 to $150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026. I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof. \n\nNFI, there's a chance China sends this to $0 with export controls so don't follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts. But if this goes to $0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout.   \n  \nI just thought this could also easily be a $7B company given they control 1/3rd of the world's entire substrate capacity and then 1/4th of the world's entire materials used for AI buildout.  \n  \nIt's a monopoly in mining -&gt; refining -&gt; substrate production. And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide. \n\n I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary.   \n  \nTLDR: THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY. \n\nFOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI, WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP.

        "post_text": "Okay listen up here bros. First of all, no I am not trying to pump my \u201cbags\u201d. Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open, it wouldn\u2019t move it a needle. With that being said, I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026, I believe that energy equities could outperform. Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $55 (crude). Yes, an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver. Read that again. Can it go lower? Sure. Is it sustainable? No. I think in hindsight, this will have been obvious. Sometimes, things are cheap enough. \n\nWhy am I bullish on oil? \n\nWell, I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it. I will try to keep this short and concise. In no particular order :\n\n1. The massive \"supply glut\" is overstated and demand is not as weak as forecasted either. Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 (not that IEA has any real credibility. They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row).\n\n2. Most of the world's oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale. There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked (or is close). Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices, contrary to what the Mango man wants, their production will not be growing.\n\n3. XLE makes up less than 3% of SPY. Just going back to the historical average of 6\\~8% would imply massive gains for the equities. The bullish case is not necessairly dependent on crude hitting $100.\n\n4. Seasonality. Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1.\n\n5. Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point.\n\nOne of my favorite boomers to listen to, Rick Rule, says that you don't need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities. He thinks XOM is selling at 60% of NPV, meaning at 40% discount. I'm personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant. The Canadian O&amp;G stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and I'm betting that he will enable them. He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US O&amp;G names. I'm also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks. \n\nHere\u2019s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats. \n\nXOM / CVX / COP / CNQ / SU / OXY / DVN \n\nAnyways, that's it for now. I'm off to play some poker. See you degens on Monday.",

Why?\nDemand is down and is gonna trend down all of 2026.  \n\nWhat happens in a declining price environment is countries like Nigeria or Angola (among others, many OPEC members) whose economies are almost entirely based on oil production can't adjust to lower prices.  So what do they do?  They produce more to make up for the lower prices, increasing supply, driving down price more.  \n\nOPEC likes to act like they have control over these producers and gives them quotas on paper, which are just ignored.  Then you add in all the shadow production coming out of Russia, Venezuela and others and that murkies the waters even more.  This bottom is nowhere near.  And once $49 hits, those producers will really crank up the cheap barrel production.  \n\nWhen oxy hits about $24, that's when I'll start buying.",

Broadcom has destroyed VMware and raised the prices killing off the lifetime license model and forcing upgrades - they\u2019re bleeding customers now.\n\nThe only truly viable competition is to go hypervisor and that\u2019s really only for MS customers who are only MS. \n\nThis feels like a long-term win, but I wanted to go check it here. \n\nWhat are you seeing beyond the headlines how do you think the stock will do?\n\n",
